Thanks for downloading django-admin-tools.

This application requires Python 2.4 or later and Django 1.1.0 or newer.
It is also recommended that you install the FeedParser module 
(http://www.feedparser.org/) if you want to use the feed dashboard module.

To install django-admin-tools, run the following command inside this directory::

    python setup.py install

If you have the Python ``easy_install`` utility available, you can also type 
the following to download and install in one step::

   easy_install django-admin-tools

Or if you're using ``pip``::

    pip install django-admin-tools

Or if you'd prefer you can simply place the included ``admin_tools`` directory 
somewhere on your Python path, or symlink to it from somewhere on your Python 
path; this is useful if you're working from a Mercurial checkout.
